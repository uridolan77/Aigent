# Core Project Refactoring Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Organized Core project into logical folders**:
   - Created `Interfaces/` for all interface definitions
   - Created `Models/` for data models and DTOs
   - Created `Configuration/` for configuration-related components
   - Created `Registry/` for agent registry components
   - Created `Compatibility/` for backward compatibility adapters

2. **Enhanced Core interfaces**:
   - Created enhanced `IAgentBuilder` with additional methods for ML models, guardrails, rules, and options
   - Created enhanced `IAgentRegistry` with improved filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Created enhanced `IConfigurationSection` with more flexible configuration access
   - Created enhanced `IMemoryService` with additional memory operations
   - Created enhanced `IAgent` with metadata and command processing capabilities

3. **Added new interfaces and models**:
   - Added `IMLModel` interface for machine learning models
   - Added `IGuardrail` interface for safety guardrails
   - Added `IConfigurationSectionFactory` interface for creating configuration sections
   - Enhanced `AgentConfiguration` with versioning, tags, and enabled status
   - Enhanced `ActionResult` with more detailed action result information
   - Enhanced `EnvironmentState` with more functionality
   - Enhanced `AgentCapabilities` with performance metrics

4. **Ensured backward compatibility**:
   - Marked all original interfaces as obsolete but maintained them for backward compatibility
   - Created `LegacySupport` class to convert between old and new formats
   - Created `CompatibilityAdapters` class to adapt between old and new interfaces

5. **Implemented dependency injection**:
   - Added extension methods for registering Core services
   - Added support for backward compatibility through adapters

## Documentation

- Added a `README.md` file describing the Core project
- Added a `REFACTORING.md` file documenting the changes made

## Next Steps

1. Update the examples project to demonstrate the use of the new interfaces
2. Update the API project to use the new interfaces
3. Add unit tests for the new components
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes
5. Apply the same refactoring pattern to other projects (Memory, Safety, etc.)

## Benefits

- Better organization of code with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced interfaces with more functionality
- Backward compatibility ensures existing code continues to work
- Consistent design patterns across the codebase
- Improved discoverability through logical folder structure
- Comprehensive documentation makes it easier for new developers to understand the project
