# Core Project Refactoring

## Overview

The Core project has been refactored to align with the enhanced interfaces and implementations in the Configuration project. This ensures consistency across the codebase and better separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

The Core project has been organized into the following logical folders:

- `Interfaces/`: Contains all interface definitions
- `Models/`: Contains data models and DTOs
- `Configuration/`: Contains configuration-related components
- `Registry/`: Contains agent registry components
- `Compatibility/`: Contains compatibility adapters for backward compatibility

## Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Interfaces**:
   - `IAgentBuilder`: Added methods for ML models, guardrails, rules, and options
   - `IAgentRegistry`: Improved filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - `IConfigurationSection`: Added more flexible configuration access
   - `IMemoryService`: Enhanced with additional memory operations
   - `IAgent`: Added metadata and command processing capabilities

2. **New Interfaces**:
   - `IMLModel`: Interface for machine learning models
   - `IGuardrail`: Interface for safety guardrails
   - `IConfigurationSectionFactory`: Factory for creating configuration sections

3. **Enhanced Models**:
   - `AgentConfiguration`: Added versioning, tags, and enabled status
   - `ActionResult`: Added more detailed action result information
   - `EnvironmentState`: Enhanced with more functionality
   - `AgentCapabilities`: Added performance metrics

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - All original interfaces are marked as obsolete but maintained
   - `LegacySupport` class provides conversion between old and new formats
   - `CompatibilityAdapters` class adapts between old and new interfaces

5. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Added extension methods for registering Core services
   - Support for backward compatibility through adapters

## Migration Path

Existing code can continue to use the original interfaces, but new code should use the enhanced interfaces in the `Interfaces` namespace. The compatibility layer ensures that both old and new code can work together seamlessly.

For example, instead of:
```csharp
using Aigent.Core;

var builder = new AgentBuilder();
```

New code should use:
```csharp
using Aigent.Core.Interfaces;
using Aigent.Core.Models;

var builder = new EnhancedAgentBuilder();
```

## Next Steps

1. Update the examples project to demonstrate the use of the new interfaces
2. Update the API project to use the new interfaces
3. Add unit tests for the new components
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes
