# Orchestration Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the `Aigent.Orchestration` project to align with the established patterns applied to the Core, Memory, Safety, and Communication projects. The refactoring focuses on creating a more maintainable, extensible codebase with better separation of concerns and enhanced features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure Reorganization

The project has been reorganized into a more logical structure:

- `Interfaces/`: All interface definitions
- `Models/`: Data models and DTOs
- `Orchestrators/`: Orchestrator implementations
- `Engines/`: Workflow engine implementations
- `Compatibility/`: Backward compatibility support

### 2. Enhanced Interfaces

#### IOrchestrator

The orchestrator interface has been enhanced with additional methods:

- Async versions of all methods (RegisterAgentAsync, UnregisterAgentAsync, etc.)
- Agent management capabilities (GetRegisteredAgents, GetAgent)
- Workflow management (ExecuteWorkflowAsync, GetWorkflowStatusAsync, CancelWorkflowAsync)
- Configuration support (Configure method)

#### IOrchestratorFactory

A new factory interface for creating orchestrators with different configurations.

#### IWorkflowEngine

A new interface specifically for workflow execution engines, separating workflow execution concerns from orchestration concerns.

### 3. Enhanced Models

#### WorkflowDefinition

Enhanced with additional properties:

- Unique identifier
- Description and tags for better categorization
- Version tracking
- Validation rules
- Retry policies
- Enhanced error handling modes

#### WorkflowStep

Enhanced with additional properties:

- Unique identifier
- Description
- Timeout settings
- Retry capabilities
- Error handling options (ContinueOnFailure, IsCritical)
- Fallback steps

#### WorkflowResult

Enhanced with:

- More detailed result tracking
- Timestamps for performance measurement
- Structured error information
- Output data

#### New Models

- `WorkflowContext`: For passing execution context to workflows
- `WorkflowStatus`: For tracking the state of workflows
- `OrchestratorConfiguration`: For configuring orchestrators
- `WorkflowEngineConfiguration`: For configuring workflow engines

### 4. Implementation Changes

#### StandardOrchestrator

A comprehensive orchestrator implementation with:

- Better error handling
- Metrics and logging integration
- Workflow status tracking
- Agent selection based on capabilities and load

#### StandardWorkflowEngine

A specialized workflow execution engine with:

- Support for all workflow types (Sequential, Parallel, Conditional, Hierarchical)
- Cancellation support
- Timeout handling
- Detailed status tracking

### 5. Dependency Injection Support

Added DependencyInjection.cs with extension methods for registering all orchestration services with the dependency injection container.

### 6. Backward Compatibility

Added LegacySupport.cs with adapter classes to maintain compatibility with existing code that uses the old interfaces.

## Migration Path

Existing code can continue to use the old interfaces without modification. The adapters in the Compatibility namespace will bridge the gap between old code and new implementation.

For new code, it's recommended to use the new interfaces directly to take advantage of all the new features.

## Future Improvements

- Add more specialized workflow engines for different use cases
- Implement distributed workflow execution
- Add persistence support for long-running workflows
- Enhance monitoring and visualization capabilities
- Create a workflow designer UI
