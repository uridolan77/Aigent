## Safety Project Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring done for the Aigent.Safety project.

### Overview

The Aigent.Safety project has been refactored to provide a more modular, maintainable, and extensible approach to safety validation. The project now follows the same architectural patterns established in other refactored projects (Core, Configuration, Memory).

### Key Components

#### Interfaces

- **ISafetyValidator**: Enhanced interface for safety validation with additional methods for text validation, guardrail management, and action type restriction management.
- **IGuardrail**: New interface for implementing safety guardrails that can be composed to create flexible validation pipelines.
- **ISafetyValidatorFactory**: Factory interface for creating validators and guardrails.

#### Models

- **ValidationResult**: Enhanced model for representing validation results with support for severity levels.
- **GuardrailEvaluationResult**: Model for individual guardrail evaluation results.
- **SafetyConfiguration**: Configuration model for safety validators.
- **GuardrailConfiguration**: Configuration model for guardrails.

#### Base Implementations

- **BaseSafetyValidator**: Base implementation of the ISafetyValidator interface with common functionality.
- **StandardSafetyValidator**: Default implementation with restricted action types and support for guardrails.
- **BaseGuardrail**: Base implementation of the IGuardrail interface with common functionality.

#### Specific Guardrails

- **ContentModerationGuardrail**: Guardrail for detecting harmful or toxic content.
- **ProfanityFilterGuardrail**: Guardrail for detecting and filtering profanity.

### Backward Compatibility

Backward compatibility is maintained through:
- Legacy classes and adapters that implement the original interfaces.
- Conversion utilities between old and new formats.
- The LegacySupport class which provides methods for working with legacy components.

### Dependency Injection

The refactored project includes support for dependency injection through:
- Extension methods for registering safety services.
- Factory classes that can be registered in the DI container.
- Support for different service lifetimes (singleton, scoped).

### Future Enhancements

The refactored design allows for easy extension with new guardrail types:
- PII detection
- Jailbreak prevention
- Prompt injection protection
- Bias detection
- Security vulnerability analysis

### Usage Examples

```csharp
// Register services
services.AddAigentSafety();

// Use in a controller or service
public class SomeService
{
    private readonly ISafetyValidator _validator;
    
    public SomeService(ISafetyValidator validator)
    {
        _validator = validator;
    }
    
    public async Task<bool> ValidateTextAsync(string text)
    {
        var result = await _validator.ValidateTextAsync(text);
        return result.IsValid;
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each guardrail is a separate component that can be used independently.
2. **Extensibility**: New guardrails can be added without modifying existing code.
3. **Configurability**: All aspects of safety validation can be configured.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Services can be easily injected and mocked for testing.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with the new implementation.
