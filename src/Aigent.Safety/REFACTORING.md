## Safety Refactoring Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Created Logical Folder Structure**
   - Interfaces/ - Contains all interface definitions
   - Models/ - Contains data models and DTOs
   - Validators/ - Contains validator implementations
   - Guardrails/ - Contains guardrail implementations
   - Compatibility/ - Contains backward compatibility adapters

2. **Enhanced Interfaces**
   - ISafetyValidator with additional methods like ValidateTextAsync, AddGuardrail, etc.
   - IGuardrail for implementing safety guardrails
   - ISafetyValidatorFactory for creating validators and guardrails

3. **Improved Models**
   - ValidationResult with severity levels and detailed information
   - GuardrailEvaluationResult for individual guardrail checks
   - SafetyConfiguration for configuring validators
   - GuardrailConfiguration for configuring guardrails

4. **Base Implementations**
   - BaseSafetyValidator as foundation for validators
   - BaseGuardrail as foundation for guardrails

5. **Specific Implementations**
   - StandardSafetyValidator with default restrictions
   - ContentModerationGuardrail for detecting harmful content
   - ProfanityFilterGuardrail for detecting and filtering profanity

6. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Added adapters for legacy interface consumers
   - Created conversion utilities
   - Marked original interfaces as obsolete

7. **Dependency Injection Support**
   - Added extension methods for registering services
   - Added factory classes for creating components

### Benefits

- **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility.
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: New guardrails can be added without changing core code.
- **Better Configuration**: All aspects can be configured through configuration objects.
- **Cleaner Integration**: Components work well with dependency injection.
- **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing code can still use the refactored components.

### Moving Forward

This refactoring establishes patterns that should be followed in other parts of the system. Additional guardrails can be implemented following the established patterns.

The next step is to refactor the Communication project using similar patterns.
