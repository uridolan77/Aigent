# API Project Refactoring

## Overview

The Aigent.Api project has been refactored to align with the enhanced interfaces and implementations in the Core, Memory, Safety, and Communication projects. This ensures consistency across the codebase and better separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

The API project has been organized into the following logical folders:

- `Controllers/`: REST API controllers
- `Models/`: Data transfer objects and request/response models
- `Interfaces/`: Core interface definitions
- `Services/`: Service implementations
- `Middleware/`: HTTP pipeline middleware components
- `Extensions/`: Extension methods for service registration and configuration
- `Validators/`: Input validation rules and helpers
- `Constants/`: Constants used throughout the API
- `Authentication/`: Authentication-related components
- `Hubs/`: SignalR hubs for real-time communication
- `Analytics/`: API analytics and monitoring
- `Configuration/`: Configuration-related components

## Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Interfaces**:
   - `IAgentRegistry`: Extracted from existing implementation, improved with better contracts
   - `ITokenService`: Enhanced with refresh token support and async methods
   - `IUserService`: Expanded with more comprehensive user management
   - `IApiAnalyticsService`: Improved with detailed metrics and async operations

2. **New Services**:
   - `AgentRegistryService`: Improved agent registry with better error handling and metrics
   - `TokenService`: JWT token service with refresh token support
   - `UserService`: Enhanced user service with better security
   - `ApiAnalyticsService`: Comprehensive API analytics with performance metrics

3. **Direct Interface Implementation**:
   - New interfaces replace the original interfaces
   - Clean implementation without legacy adapters
   - Focused on modern, maintainable code structure

4. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Added extension methods for registering API services
   - Comprehensive registration of all services with proper lifetimes
   - Support for backward compatibility through adapters

5. **Enhanced Middleware**:
   - Error handling middleware with better logging and client-friendly responses
   - Rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
   - API analytics middleware for performance monitoring
   - Request logging middleware for debugging and auditing

6. **Constants and Validators**:
   - Constants for route names, policy names, and other configurable values
   - Input validators for all request models
   - Standardized validation approach

## Migration Path

The original interfaces have been replaced with enhanced interfaces in the `Interfaces` namespace. All code that depended on the original interfaces will need to be updated to use the new interfaces.

For example:
```csharp
using Aigent.Api.Interfaces;

public class MyClass
{
    private readonly ITokenService _tokenService;

    public MyClass(ITokenService tokenService)
    {
        _tokenService = tokenService;
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Update controller implementations to use the new interfaces
2. Enhance middleware components with the new services
3. Improve error handling and validation in controllers
4. Add unit tests for the new components
5. Update API documentation to reflect the changes
